# Technology Change, Informatics, and Forecasting (TCIF) Lab

Welcome to the **TCIF Lab** ‚Äì an interdisciplinary research lab focused on understanding and shaping the future of technology through data-driven foresight. We explore how technological systems evolve, how information is structured and leveraged, and how intelligent forecasting can inform policy, strategy, and innovation.

## üåê What We Do

At the core of our work is the **TCIF framework**:

- **Technology Change (T)**: We analyze the evolution and transformation of technology ecosystems‚Äîtracking adoption patterns, disruption triggers, and system dynamics.
- **Informatics (I)**: We design and apply data architectures, AI models, and analytical pipelines to process structured and unstructured information from patents, technical specifications, social discourse, and more.
- **Forecasting (F)**: Using advanced methods including machine learning, econometrics, and topic modeling, we generate actionable foresight for sustainable innovation and decision-making in business, healthcare, policy, and education.

We adopt a **systems thinking perspective**, combining academic rigor with real-world applications through collaborations in areas such as blockchain, public health, sustainable manufacturing, AI governance, and digital supply chains.
